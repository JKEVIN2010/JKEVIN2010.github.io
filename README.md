## This repository contains  my progress in the field of computational Finance & Algorithmic Trading

#### 1- *The program "Personal_Financial_Indicator is a customised financial indicator that I created  similar to a simple moving average*

#### 2- *The program called "Blackscholes" is a simple code that computes the fair price of an option using the well-known Black-Scholes-Merton Formula*

#### 3- *The  program "Stock_Visualize" simply plots a technical chart of any stock in within a specific timeframe. In our code we use the stock of AMAZON(AMZN) and the technical chart can be found at [AMZN Chart.pdf](https://github.com/JKEVIN2010/JKEVIN2010.github.io/files/1254693/AMZN.Chart.pdf)*

#### 4- *The program "Stock_Chart_Manipulation" provides an advanced chart of the stock of the company Apple(AAPL) combined with multiple financial indicators including volatility indicators(Bollinger bands), simple moving average(SMA) as well as the overall momentum of the stock over the past three months. The chart can be found here [APPL Technical Chart.pdf](https://github.com/JKEVIN2010/JKEVIN2010.github.io/files/1254982/APPL.Technical.Chart.pdf)*

## This repository contains  my progress in the field of computational Finance & Algorithmic Trading

#### 1- *The program "Personal_Financial_Indicator is a customised financial indicator that I created  similar to a simple moving average*

#### 2- *The program called "Blackscholes" is a simple code that computes the fair price of an option using the well-known Black-Scholes-Merton Formula*

#### 3- *The  program "Stock_Visualize" simply plots a technical chart of any stock in within a specific timeframe. In our code we use the stock of AMAZON(AMZN) and the technical chart can be found in the file above called AMZN Chart*
